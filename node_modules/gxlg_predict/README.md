Usage example:

```js
const predict = require("gxlg_predict")

var wordlist = [ "apple", "banana", "juice" ]
var cursed = "spplw"

console.log(predict(wordlist, cursed))
//outputs "apple"
```

Right now there are following layouts:
* `qwerty`
* `йцукен`

`qwerty` is used by default.

You can specify, which to choose, by adding a parameter:

```js
console.log(predict(wordlist, cursed, "йцукен"))
```

Or use your own:

```js
var custom_layout = [
  [ /* first row characters, splitted into an array */ ],
  [ /* second row  ... */ ],
  ...
]

console.log(predict(wordlist, cursed, custom_layout))
```
Warning: Currently only supports lowcase.

Could be useful for making a cli based on Node.
